When starting a new app, it's important to decide how it's going to handle and display dates. Once that has been decided, you can add some practic `static` DateFormatters that encapsulate that decisions to reuse across the app.

## Example:

Using [this](https://github.com/mdb1/DateFormatterOptions) SwiftUI playground app, you can play around with the different properties of the `DateFormatter` and check the output string.
