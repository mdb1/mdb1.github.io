Recently, I stumbled upon Lickability's [repository](https://github.com/Lickability/swift-best-practices) on swift-best-practices, and it got me thinking about my own [Contributing guidelines](https://mdb1.github.io/2023-01-02-new-app-contributing-guidelines/) that I wrote a while back. I realized they might not be as scalable as I'd like over time.

So I decided to write my own set of guidelines that's a mix of Lickability's best practices, my personal experiences, and my own coding style. 

[Here](https://github.com/mdb1/best-practices-example/) is the repository in case you want to check it out.

The idea is to use the [Contributing](https://github.com/mdb1/best-practices-example/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) document as a kind of table-of-contents and link all the smaller documents from there:

From there, you can get as atomic as you want, and you can document every decision that you or your team make in terms of the codebase over time.
