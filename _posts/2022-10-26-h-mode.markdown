`H mode` is a protocol to follow in order to get things done.

First of all, we need to set up the environment:

- No clutter in your physical desktop, and no clutter in your computer desktop.

Having an organized desktop will make everything better:

During your `H mode` periods, you will have a set of rules that you must follow every single day. No excuses:

1. No alcohol / No weed. 
I donâ€™t care what you have to say, this rule means absolutely 0 of both.
2. Two `deep-work` slots a day. 
Deep work means no distractions. No phone in the room, and no notifications allowed. Only focused work.
3. 10.000 steps a day.
A little bit of movement every day will allow you to have clearer thoughts.

On top of that, I encourage you to add up to `3` more rules, but no more than that, otherwise, it could become overwhelming. Some examples:

- Eat healthily
- Exercise
- Read
- Play an instrument
- Zero or limited social media time
- Etc

You will quickly realize after a couple of weeks of `H mode` how much more productive, less distracted, and more focused you become. Also, how you can work towards your goals by adjusting your daily rules.

As an example, here is how Iâ€™ve structured my `H mode` for the last couple of months:

- 07:00 - Wake up, drink a glass of water, and bathroom stuff.
- 07:15 - Go for an outdoor 45-minute walk.
- 08:00 - Prepare my mate ðŸ§‰, read a book for 15 minutes and read an article related to my industry (mostly SwiftUI stuff lately). After all of that, I pick up the phone for the first time in the day.
- ~08:30 - 12:00 - First `deep-work` slot. No phone in my office room, no notifications on Slack.
- 12:00 - 13:00 - First meal of the day. Dessert: a banana and a protein shake.
- 13:00 - 13:30 - Brief walk. Answer Slack messages, check emails.
- 13:30 - 16:30 - Second `deep-work` slot. No phone in my office room, no notifications on Slack.
- 16:30 - 17:00 - Answer Slack messages, cool-down from second deep-work slot.
- 17:00 - 17:45 - Weight or Cardio training.
- At this point the day is over, so I donâ€™t have a clear agenda until ~20:30.
- ~20:30 - 21:30 - Dinner + Brief walk.
- 21:30 - 22:00 - Shower.
- ~22:30 - Go to sleep.
