A really fast and easy way to getyour app's crash logs is built-in right in Xcode.

By opening the Organizer `⌘ + ⌥ + ⇧ + O`, and navigating to the Crash tab for the app you want to see the crash logs:

Then just tapping on the `Open in Project` button will offer you a lot of insights about the selected crash.
