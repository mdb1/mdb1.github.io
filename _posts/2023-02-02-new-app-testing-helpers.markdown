When starting a new app, I like to have some XCTest helpers to enhance testability.

# MemoryDeallocation

This is a method to be used at the end of the unit tests to determine that the instance gets deallocated from memory correctly; Way faster than using the memory graph ðŸ˜‰.

It leverages the addTeardownBlock method on XCTest:

`Teardown blocks are executed after the current test method has returned but before tearDown is invoked.`

# AssertState

Runs the assertions provided for the publisher variable.
Very useful for testing state transitions when working with SwiftUI's views.

# AsyncAssert

Runs the assertions provided in the main thread in an async way.
Useful for testing objects that make async requests (using mocked protocols for the responses)
