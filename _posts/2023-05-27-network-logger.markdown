When developing Swift applications that involve network communication, it's often essential to have visibility into the details of the network requests and responses. This includes information such as HTTP headers, URLs, request bodies, and response data. In order to facilitate this logging process, I have created a simple and lightweight struct called NetworkLogger as part of the [CoreNetworking](https://github.com/mdb1/CoreNetworking) library.

The code can be found [here](https://github.com/mdb1/CoreNetworking/blob/main/Sources/CoreNetworking/NetworkLogger.swift). It should be easy to understand and integrate into your existing project.

## Example:
The NetworkLogger struct generates informative logs that help you track the progress of your network requests. Here's an example of what the log output would look like:

```swift
üõú ===> Network Request started:
‚ñø 3 key/value pairs
  ‚ñø (2 elements)
    - key: "URL"
    - value: "https://catfact.ninja/fact/?"
  ‚ñø (2 elements)
    - key: "HTTP Method"
    - value: "GET"
  ‚ñø (2 elements)
    - key: "Request\'s Internal Id"
    - value: "[3E786]"
üõú <==== Network Response received:
‚ñø 3 key/value pairs
  ‚ñø (2 elements)
    - key: "Request\'s Internal Id"
    - value: "[3E786]"
  ‚ñø (2 elements)
    - key: "URL"
    - value: "https://catfact.ninja/fact/?"
  ‚ñø (2 elements)
    - key: "Status Code"
    - value: "200"
‚úÖ ==> JSON Decoding start:
‚ñø CoreNetworkingTests.CatFact
  - fact: "A cat\'s brain is more similar to a man\'s brain than that of a dog."
  - length: 66
‚ÑπÔ∏è Additional Info:
‚ñø 2 key/value pairs
  ‚ñø (2 elements)
    - key: "Expected Model"
    - value: "CatFact"
  ‚ñø (2 elements)
    - key: "UTF8 - String"
    - value: "{\"fact\":\"A cat\'s brain is more similar to a man\'s brain than that of a dog.\",\"length\":66}"
‚úÖ <== JSON Decoding end.
üèÅ <==== Network Request finished.
```

By incorporating the NetworkLogger struct into your Swift projects, you can easily track and inspect network requests, responses, and JSON decoding results.
