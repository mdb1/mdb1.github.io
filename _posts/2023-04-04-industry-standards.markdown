Staying up-to-date with the latest iOS industry standards is essential for any iOS developer. Apple's mobile operating system is constantly evolving, and keeping up with the changes is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge in the industry. With new updates, features, and technologies being released every year, it's important to have a `systematic` approach to staying informed.

One approach that has worked for me is a combination of newsletter subscriptions, email filters, and Notion. Here's how it works:

# 1. Newsletter Subscriptions
There are several newsletters that cover the latest news and trends in the iOS industry. Subscribing to newsletters is a great way to stay informed about the latest developments in the iOS ecosystem.

Some examples to get started:

# 2. Email Filters
Once you've subscribed to these newsletters, it's important to set up some filters in your email client, to avoid getting distracted daily. This will help you avoid cluttering your inbox and allow you to focus on the newsletters at a later time.

## 2.1 Needs Action Label
To ensure that you don't miss out on any important updates, create a "Needs Action" label and apply it to the newsletters as they come in. This will help you keep track of the newsletters that require your attention.

The filter that I use is the following:
* If -> `Has the words: "Newsletter"`
* Then -> `Mark as read` & `Apply the label: "Needs Action"`

*You could manually add more filters to the specific newsletters that doesn't have the word "Newsletter" if needed.*

It looks like this:

# 3. Notion
Notion is a powerful tool for organizing information and taking notes. I use the [Notion Web Clipper Chrome](https://www.notion.so/Web-Clipper-ba54b19ecaeb466b8070b9e683c5fce1) extension to add the most interesting articles from the newsletters to a table view. This makes it easy to keep track of the articles I want to read and refer back to later.

# 4. Weekly Review
Once a week, I set aside some time to review all the newsletters with the "Needs Action" label. I go through each email and add the most relevant articles to my Notion table view.

# 5. Daily Reading
Every day, I pick one article from my Notion table view and read it. It's important to remember that simply reading the articles won't be enough. To truly acquire the knowledge, it's important to put the articles into practice.

[Daily habits](/2022-01-15-rules-and-habits/) are critical to maintaining consistency and achieving long-term success. When it comes to staying up-to-date with the latest iOS industry standards, it's important to create a daily habit of reading at least one article or tutorial.

To ensure that you don't lose your streak, it's helpful to set specific goals and hold yourself accountable. You could also use a habit tracker app to track your progress and hold yourself accountable.

Remember that building a habit takes time and effort, and it's okay to have setbacks. If you miss a day, don't beat yourself up about it. Instead, focus on getting back on track the next day and continuing to build your daily habit.

Consistency is key when it comes to staying up-to-date with the latest iOS industry standards. By creating daily habits and holding yourself accountable, you can stay on top of the latest developments in the industry and continue to grow as an iOS developer.

# Conclusion
Keeping up with the latest iOS industry standards is crucial for any iOS developer. By using a combination of newsletter subscriptions, email filters, and Notion, you can create a systematic approach to staying informed. Remember to take the time to read and implement the knowledge you acquire, and you'll be on your way to becoming a successful iOS developer.
