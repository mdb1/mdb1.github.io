# 1. Switching off AutoPilot mode

AutoPilot mode enables us to keep up with life‚Äôs demands (Automated decisions).

But some decisions are worth making deliberately. How we manage our attention is one of them.

<aside>
üìå The more we can manage our attention, the more focused, productive, and creative we become.

</aside>

Directing your attention toward the most important object of your choosing‚Äîand then sustaining that attention‚Äîis the most consequential decision we will make throughout the day.

## The four types of tasks

|  | Unattractive | Attractive |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Productive | Necessary work (meetings) | Purposeful work (the tasks we are put on earth to do) |
| Unproductive | Unnecessary work (cleaning up) | Distracting work (social media) |

# 2. The limits of your attention

- Meta-awareness: Becoming aware of what you‚Äôre thinking about is one of the best practices for managing our attention.
- Mindfulness: Notice what your mind is full of.

## Attentional Space

There are 3 combinations of tasks that can fit well inside our attentional space:

1. A few small, habitual tasks (Walking + Breathing + Music).
2. A task that requires most of our attention, as well as a habitual task (Simple video game + Audiobook).
3. One complex task.

## Attention overload

At any one time, your attentional space should hold two key things:

1. What you intend to accomplish.
2. What you are currently doing.

<aside>
üìå Productivity means accomplishing what we intend to do.

</aside>

## Put advice into practice

1. Set intentions more often.
2. Modify your environment to be less distracting.
3. Overcome then mental resistance you have to certain tasks.
4. Eliminate distractions **before** they derail you.
5. Clear the distractions inside your head.

## Measurements

1. How much of your time you spend intentionally?
2. How long can you hold your focus in one sitting?
3. How long your mind wanders before you catch it?

# 3. The power of Hyperfocus

<aside>
üìå When you hyper focus on a task, you expand one task, project, or other object of attention so it fills your attentional space completely.

</aside>

## Steps to HyperFocus

1. Choose a productive or meaningful object of attention.
2. Eliminate as many external and internal distractions as you can.
3. Focus on that object of attention.
4. Continually draw your focus back to that one object of attention.

<aside>
üìå Sum up: Keep 1 important, complex object of attention in your awareness as you work.

</aside>

## How to set Stronger intentions

**Setting specific intentions can double your odds of success.**

‚ÄúI‚Äôll go to the gym and workout for 60 minutes at 08:00Am‚Äú is way better than ‚ÄúGoing to the gym‚Äù.

## Staring a Hyperfocus ritual

1. Set how long you want to Hyperfocus for.
2. Anticipate obstacles ahead of time.
3. Set a timer.
4. Hyperfocus.

# 4. Taming Distractions

Once you become aware of how frequently you interrupt yourself, it‚Äôs hard to go back to working the same way again.

## Four types of distractions/interruptions

|  | Annoying | Fun |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No Control | Meetings, Chats | Visitors |
| Control | Email, Notifications | Twitter, Whatsapp, etc |

## Two modes of working

|  | Annoying | Fun |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No Control | Deal with, get back on track | Enjoy! |
| Control | Deal with ahead of time | Deal with ahead of time |

### 1. Distraction Free mode

- Use a distraction blocking app (for Twitter, Email, Reddit, etc)
- Turn on `Do not Disturbe` mode
- Phone out of sight
- Mate drink üßâ
- Noise-cancelling headphones

### 2. Regular, Reduced-Distraction working mode

Setting a specific time to focus on distractions (email, twitter, phone, etc) transform them from distractions to purposeful elements of your work and life.

## Meetings

- Never attend a meeting without an agenda.
- Question every recurring meeting on your calendar.
- Challenge the attendance list.
- Hyperfocus on meetings.

## Internet

Try disconnecting completely for a period of 24 hours this Sunday.

## Simplifying your Environment

You should eliminate objects of attention from your environment that will potentially derail your focus:

1. Make a list of all potential distractions.
2. Remove the from the room.
3. Introduce more productive cues.
4. Clean Up.

# 5. Making Hyperfocus a Habit

Meditation and Mindfulness teach you to focus for longer periods of time.

- Meditation ‚Üí Focus on a particular task (Breathing).
- Mindfulness ‚Üí Be present in the moment.

## Incorporate Meditation and Mindfulness in your life

To meditate, sit down and focus on your breathing for a given amount of time each day. You can use an app like `Headspace` to guide you.

To practice Mindfulness, pick a single daily task and be mindful doing it (Pay attention to everything that is happening). Example: Eating a meal.

Your mind will wander during both practices, this is completely normal.

## Maintain your Focus

### Match your tasks to your skill level

- Boredom occurs when your tasks are too easy.
- Stress occurs when your tasks are too difficult.

### Increase the number of high-impact tasks you do

Evaluate how much time you spend doing low-impact tasks. If it‚Äôs higher than you like, increase the number of high-impact tasks on your plate.

# 6. Understanding Intentional Mind-Wandering

‚ÄúScatterfocus‚Äù = Intentional Mind-Wandering

Deliberately leave a lot of room in your working memory, which causes your mind to wander.

1. Mind-Wandering helps you plan for the future.
2. Mind-Wandering increases our creativity.
3. Mind-Wandering lets us rest.

## How to Mind-Wander intentionally

- Perform a fun but easy task (walking).
- Schedule time to record your ideas (two 15 minute blocks per week, just you, a pen, and a paper).

# 7. How to Rest your brain properly

In order to be productive you need to be properly rested.

Instead of viewing breaks as a waste of time, view them as an essential element of being the most productive, healthy version of yourself.

- Practice Intentional Mind-Wandering.
- Get a good night‚Äôs sleep.
