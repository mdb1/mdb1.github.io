When starting a new app, it's important to write the [contributing guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors) to help your team do good work, and keep a consistent codebase over time.

Some things to include in this file are:

- Coding principles
- Git strategy
- Testing strategy
- Coding conventions
- Code of conduct
