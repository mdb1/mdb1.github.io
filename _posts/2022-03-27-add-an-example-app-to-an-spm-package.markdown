## Creating the Package

To create a new SPM Package just follow this sequence:

```
Itâ€™s important to notice that your Package.swift must be placed
in the root of the repository.
This is only needed if the package will have it's own repository.
```

1. Open Xcode
2. Go to File â†’ New â†’ Package â†’ Give it a name and hit Create.

Thatâ€™s it. **You have created your Package** ðŸŽ‰.

## Creating the ExampleApp

To create the ExampleApp just follow this sequence:

1. Open Xcode
2. File â†’ New â†’ Project â†’ App â†’ Give it a name and hit Create.

Thatâ€™s it. **You have created your ExampleApp** ðŸŽ‰.

Now we can do some clean up to make the ExampleApp as simple as possible:

1. Remove Main.storyboard
2. Remove SceneDelegate.swift
3. In the Info.plist, remove the following entries:
- Main storyboard file base name
- Application Scene Manifest
4. Remove all the code in the AppDelegate and replace it with this:

```swift
import UIKit

@main
final class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    var window: UIWindow?
    private lazy var navigationController = UINavigationController()

    func application(
        _: UIApplication,
        didFinishLaunchingWithOptions _: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
    ) -> Bool {
        window = UIWindow()
        guard let window = window else { fatalError("Can't start without a window") }

        navigationController.setViewControllers([ViewController()], animated: true)
        window.rootViewController = navigationController
        window.makeKeyAndVisible()

        return true
    }
}
```
## Linking the ExampleApp and the Package

In Xcode with the ExampleApp project open:

1. File â†’ Add packages... â†’ Add Local â†’ Select the root directory (The package) â†’ Add Package.
2. Now go to the Build Phases of the project â†’ Link Binary with Libraries â†’ Hit the `+` button â†’ Select the package.

Thatâ€™s it. **Now the ExampleApp can import the Package** ðŸŽ‰.

## Importing the Package on another project
```
This section assumes that your package is hosted on github.
```

Open your project in Xcode:

1. File â†’ Add packages... â†’ Search for the github URL of the project â†’ Add the dependency rules that you want â†’ Add to your project â†’ Add Package.
2. Now you have to wait for Xcode to fetch the package.

Thatâ€™s it. **Now your project can import the Package** ðŸŽ‰.
