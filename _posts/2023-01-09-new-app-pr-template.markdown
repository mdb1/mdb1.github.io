When starting a new app, I like to set up the Pull Request Template, so we can set up so common ground rules for the project.

Creating it is pretty simple, you just need to create a new file inside the `.github` folder called `pull_request_template.md`

## Example:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/mdb1/3e773aa8eedc4e38dd3b5b501c7c72cd.js"></script>
