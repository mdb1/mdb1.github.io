Hi there! 

In this blog, I share my thoughts and insights mainly about iOS development, building software, best practices, some books and productivity tips.

I'd say that I'm a `purist` of the things that work as expected and that are easy to maintain. I also put a great amount of effort into automated testing for software.

Rate all the variables from 0 to 1 (i.e: 0.7, 0.5, 0.9, 1.0).

The closer the final number is to `1`, the better the architecture is.
